/**
In many ways, the audio driver controls what the rest of the system
is doing, as the audio hardware works on its own time and controls
when "now" is. Further, we can't switch audio sources until the
hardware asks for packets.

Commands are passed in via a queue. Incoming commands are batched and
only executed upon receipt of a Commit command. The application of
commits is indicated in the command ID field of the timecode in the shared
driver state.

A time of ~0 indicates an unrecoverable error in a stream; a command
ID of ~0 in the timecode indicates a complete device failure.

Drivers are guaranteed to
